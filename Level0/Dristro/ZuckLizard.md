The idea that Mark Zuckerberg is a "lizard" is actually a humorous reference to a popular internet meme and conspiracy theory claiming that some high-profile people are "lizard people" or "reptilians." This theory was popularized as part of a satire on the concept of powerful individuals being part of a hidden, secret group controlling the world.<br></br>
Of course, there's no factual basis for this! It's a fun, absurd meme that many enjoy playing along with online. Zuckerberg himself has even joked about it in interviews, acknowledging how widespread the joke has become.
