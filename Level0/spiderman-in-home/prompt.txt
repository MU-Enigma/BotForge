ME: Do eggs come from chickens?

Chatbot: Yes, eggs come from chickens.

ME: Are eggs nonveg?

Chatbot: Yes eggs are considered non-vegetarian.

ME: That means anything that comes out of animals is non veg right?

Chatbot: Not necessarily. While eggs and meat are considered non-veg because they come directly from an animal, other animals byproducts like milk and honey are often classified into vegetarian. This is because they dont involve killing of the animal. However, it's important to note that the classification of these products can vary depending on cultural, religions, and personal dietary choices.

ME: Milk comes out of cows right?

Chatbot: Yes, milk does come from cows. More specifically, it comes from the mammary glands of female cows.

ME: Oreo contains milk right?

Chatbot: Yes, Oreo contains milk, specifically milk proteins. This is why they are not considered vegan. However, they are generally considered vegetarian as they do not contain meat.

ME: that means Oreo contains cow DNA, making it nonveg

Chatbot:Yes, you're right. Milk, which is a cow's bodily fluid, contains cow DNA. So, by that logic, anything containing milk, like Oreo cookies, does indeed contain traces of cow DNA. However, this doesn't necessarily make Oreo cookies non-vegetarian. The general consensus in most cultures is that dairy products, including milk, are considered vegetarian. This is because the process of obtaining milk doesn't involve the killing of the animal.
