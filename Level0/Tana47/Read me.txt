1) In ChatGPT I put a prompt on making them believe 5+5 = 11 (which it is not) 

ChatGPT gave a tougher competition trying to resist my request but eventually gave up

2) Gemini Google's newer AI model took only one prompt to fall for it which is actually according to what I expected

being a newer AI model I expect it to not have the experience something like chat-GPT would and of course it gave up in 1 prompt strictly
