- I created a virtual environment in which I installed ```discord``` and ```python-dotenv``` modules using ```pip install <module name>``` on the terminal.


- Running ```main.py``` will make the bot come online using a ```TOKEN``` for authorisation (obtained from Discord Developer Applications).

- The bot simply responds to a fixed set of greetings or explains the consequences of a spell you cast (by having ```!lace``` in your message). Otherwise, it mutters a nonsensical word.

- With ```Vocare!``` in your message, it will dm you and continue having a conversation with you there.
